- Prefer simplicity in design and implementation.
- Use only the tech stack currently adopted in the project.
  - Vike
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - Zustand for UI state mgmt
  - XState for game state
  - Tailwind
  - Daisy UI
- Favor small files and components for maintainability.
- Small files are easier to read, test, and refactor, so also add tests :)
- Prefer placing tests near the code they are testing, not in a separate directory. e.g. for components/foo.tsx, the test file would be components/foo.test.tsx
